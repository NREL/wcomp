The model is derived by applying conservation of mass and momentum and assuming a Gaussian distribution for the velocity deficit in the wake. This simple model only requires one parameter to determine the velocity distribution in the wake. The results are compared to high-resolution wind-tunnel measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data of miniature wind-turbine wakes, as well as LES data of real-scale wind-turbine wakes. In general, it is found that the velocity deficit in the wake predicted by the proposed analytical model is in good agreement with the experimental and LES data. The results also show that the new model predicts the power extracted by downwind wind turbines more accurately than other common analytical models, some of which are based on less accurate assumptions like considering a top-hat shape for the velocity deficit.}

ABSTRACT = {Wind farm power production is known to be strongly affected by turbine wake effects. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new analytical model for the prediction of wind turbine wakes and the associated power losses in wind farms. The new model is an extension of the one recently proposed by Bastankhah and Porté-Agel for the wake of stand-alone wind turbines. It satisfies the conservation of mass and momentum and assumes a self-similar Gaussian shape of the velocity deficit. The local wake growth rate is estimated based on the local streamwise turbulence intensity. Superposition of velocity deficits is used to model the interaction of the multiple wakes. Furthermore, the power production from the wind turbines is calculated using the power curve. The performance of the new analytical wind farm model is validated against power measurements and large-eddy simulation (LES) data from the Horns Rev wind farm for a wide range of wind directions, corresponding to a variety of full-wake and partial-wake conditions. A reasonable agreement is found between the proposed analytical model, LES data, and power measurements. Compared with a commonly used wind farm wake model, the new model shows a significant improvement in the prediction of wind farm power.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the setup, methodology and results from a measurement campaign dedicated to the characterization of full-scale wind turbine wakes under different inflow conditions. The measurements have been obtained from two pulsed scanning Doppler lidars mounted on the nacelle of a 2.5 MW wind turbine. The first lidar is upstream oriented and dedicated to the characterization of the inflow with a variety of scanning patterns, while the second one is downstream oriented and performs horizontal planar scans of the wake. The calculated velocity deficit profiles exhibit self-similarity in the far wake region and they can be fitted accurately to Gaussian functions. This allows for the study of the growth rate of the wake width and the recovery of the wind speed, as well as the extent of the near-wake region. The results show that a higher incoming turbulence intensity enhances the entrainment and flow mixing in the wake region, resulting in a shorter near-wake length, a faster growth rate of the wake width and a faster recovery of the velocity deficit. The relationships obtained are compared to analytical models for wind turbine wakes and allow to correct the parameters prescribed until now, which were obtained from wind-tunnel measurements and large-eddy simulations (LES), with new, more accurate values directly derived from full-scale experiments.},

doi = {10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/062072},
abstract = {We present two new models for wind turbine interaction effects and a recipe for combining them. The first model is an extension of the Park model, which explicitly incorporates turbulence, both the ambient atmospheric turbulence and the turbulence generated in the wake itself. This Turbulence Optimized Park model is better equipped to describe wake recovery over long distances such as between wind farms, where the wake expansion slows down as the turbine-generated turbulence decays. The second model is a first version of a full engineering wind farm blockage model. In the same vein as the wake model it adds blockage contributions from the individual wind turbines to form an aggregated wind farm scale blockage effect that can be incorporated directly into the park power curve and annual energy calculations. The wake model and the blockage model describe downstream and upstream turbine interaction effects, respectively. They are coupled as the outputs of one model are the inputs to the other model and vice versa. We describe how this coupling is achieved through an iterative process. We give early stage examples of the validation of the two models and discuss how they might be further validated and improved in the future.}

keywords = {wind turbine wake, wind turbine in yaw, large-eddy simulation, wake deflection, active control in wind farms},
abstract = {Abstract When a wind turbine works in yaw, the wake intensity and the power production of the turbine become slightly smaller and a deflection of the wake is induced. Therefore, a good understanding of this effect would allow an active control of the yaw angle of upstream turbines to steer the wake away from downstream machines, reducing its effect on them. In wind farms where interaction between turbines is significant, it is of interest to maximize the power output from the wind farm as a whole and to reduce fatigue loads on downstream turbines due to the increase of turbulence intensity in wakes. A large eddy simulation model with particular wind boundary conditions has been used recently to simulate and characterize the turbulence generated by the presence of a wind turbine and its evolution downstream the machine. The simplified turbine is placed within an environment in which relevant flow properties like wind speed profile, turbulence intensity and the anisotropy of turbulence are found to be similar to the ones of the neutral atmosphere. In this work, the model is used to characterize the wake deflection for a range of yaw angles and thrust coefficients of the turbine. The results are compared with experimental data obtained by other authors with a particle image velocimetry technique from wind tunnel experiments. Also, a comparison with simple analytical correlations is carried out. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Yaw induced active wake deflection is one possible wind farm control strategy, which can be applied to mitigate wake effects on nearby downstream located wind turbines. In the present study three flow models of different fidelities are applied to mimic a full-scale study of wake deflection recorded by an advanced synchronised setup of two long-range pulsed scanning lidars. The investigated case studies encompass a base case with (approximately) zero yaw setting supplemented by two non-zero yaw cases of 17.5° and -14.5°, respectively. The model results are compared mutually as well as with the result of the full-scale measurement campaign.}

However, it is not a push-button solution and effective use requires a multidisciplinary design team and expertise in optimization algorithms.
